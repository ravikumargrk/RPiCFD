# Thermal modelling : Raspberry Pi
Single board computers and microcontroller boards are often used in many automated systems. Thermal analysis of such systems is important as they are subjected to time varying and
cyclic thermal loads and their reliability is at concern. 

The objective of this project is to build a basic finite volume based, 2-Dimensional, unsteady computational model of certain electronic board configuration with time - varying heat sources, and to study its temperature response.

In this particular problem, we study the case of Raspberry Pi 2B as an academic practise.
